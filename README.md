# Beach-Cleaning-Robot
The autonomous beach cleaning robot is equipped with advanced features such as obstacle avoidance, goal-to-goal navigation, waste segregation, and environmental preservation mechanisms. Its hardware components include the Neo m8n GPS sensor, IMU sensor, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, camera, Raspberry Pi 4, Arduino Mega 2560, ESP32, servo motors, DC-geared planetary motors, motor drivers, and LiPo batteries. The robot utilizes algorithms for autonomous control and area coverage, allowing it to navigate independently while avoiding obstacles. It also offers manual control through a user-friendly WebGUI interface. The power circuit includes a buck converter circuit and multiple motor driver circuits, ensuring consistent voltage distribution. The sensor circuit incorporates ultrasonic sensors and a GPS sensor for real-time tracking, while the camera captures images for waste detection. The waste segregation mechanism utilizes the YOLO algorithm for efficient sorting between plastic and non-plastic waste. Communication is established between the Raspberry Pi, Arduino Mega, and ESP32 for motor control. Proper grounding measures are implemented to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the robot. Overall, the beach cleaning robot offers automated waste collection, efficient segregation using the grounding dino model, and preservation of the beach environment, reducing manual labor and promotingÂ sustainability.
