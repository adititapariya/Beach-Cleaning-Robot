# SWEEP: Sand Waste Elimination and Environmental Protection, a Beach Cleaning Robot
Introducing SWEEP, Sand Waste Elimination and Environmental Pollution, a revolutionary Beach Cleaning Robot at the forefront of waste management and coastal preservation. SWEEP is equipped with advanced waste collection and segregation features, making it a game-changer in beach maintenance.

SWEEP's cutting-edge design incorporates high-torque DC motors and wide tires on its four wheels, ensuring exceptional traction on sandy surfaces. The strategically positioned claws and sieves, seamlessly integrated into a chain drive conveyor system, efficiently collect and separate debris. A vibration mechanism further enhances sand removal. The waste segregation system, equipped with a proximity sensor and automated servo motors, precisely categorizes and directs waste into designated bins. As the bins reach capacity, SWEEP autonomously disposes of the waste into designated locations, adding an extra layer of efficiency and user convenience.

Operating autonomously, SWEEP is guided by a combination of GPS, IMU sensors, ultrasonic sensors, servo, and DC-geared planetary motors, powered by sustainable LiPo batteries. The integration of ESP32, Arduino Mega 2560, and Raspberry Pi-4 ensures seamless communication among key components. The user-friendly Web GUI interface allows both manual and autonomous control.

SWEEP represents an ever-evolving solution for cleaner and more sustainable coastal environments, marking a significant leap forward in beach cleaning and waste management technology.
